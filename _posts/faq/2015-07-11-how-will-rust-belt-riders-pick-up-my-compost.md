title: "How Will Rust Belt Riders Pick Up My Food Waste?"
faqtype: general

While Rust Belt Riders was born on bikes we have since moved our primary service delivery to vehicles. This has been done to capture a growing interest across the region and service a wider range of clients. Using vehicles has allowed us to make a more significant impact, service a wider range of clients, and deepen our commitment to supporting a wide range of agricultural practices. All members will receive clean containers commensurate with the volume of compostable materials being produced on a weekly basis. Presently we offer two options of containers to our clients: 17-gallon totes and 64-gallon carts.
