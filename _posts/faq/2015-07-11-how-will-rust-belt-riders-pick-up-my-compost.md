Using custom built trailers we will pick up your five-gallon bucket on bikes at an agreed upon location on your property (front porch, back door, driveway, lobby, etc) and empty your bucket into our trailer. Your bucket will be returned to the agreed upon location empty and ready to be filled up with more food scraps!
