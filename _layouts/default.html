                <h1>Why Compost?</h1>
                <span class="border"></span>
                <p>The United States EPA estimates that as much as 24% of all household waste is compostable. When food scraps are sent to landfills their decomposition process produces methane, a greenhouse gas twenty times more damaging to the o-zone than carbon dioxide. By diverting these food scraps away from land fills and into nutrient rich soil amendments we can help restore soil health, advance the work of local food production, and reduce our ecological footprints.

                        <p>An&nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency report from 2007 estimates that Americans could keep 140 pounds of waste per person per year out of the landfill by composting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                        <h5>Composing turns your waste into a useful product—and it does so without requiring additional resources.</h5>
                        <p>Compare this to recycling, where energy must be used to transport waste to the munipal recycling facility, sort the waste, transport it to the manufacturers, produce new products with it, and then send the finished products back in the other direction—to stores and, ultimately, homes and businesses.</p>

                    <h5>Using compost in your garden reduces the need for water and fertilizers and helps eliminate the need for pesticides.</h5>
                    <p>The reasons, in a nutshell, are that compost improves the soil’s moisture management, regulates the soil’s pH, provides nutrients on a slow-release basis and suppresses certain plant diseases. In addition, it can bind and degrade some pollutants in the plant’s growing environment and help control erosion.</p>

                        <p>in the cycles of nature and the folly of our throwaway culture that is likely to lead to other waste-saving measures as time goes by. It’s also a great way to teach environmental stewardship to kids if you get them involved.</p>
